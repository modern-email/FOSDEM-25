[FOSDEM] Call for Participation in the "Modern Email" Developer Room at FOSDEM '25!

For the latest info: https://github.com/modern-email/FOSDEM-25

Email is the workhorse of digital communication. It's one of the oldest
decentralized messaging platforms, and we must keep implementations up to date
with new standards/techniques/programming languages.

## Call for Participation

The "**Modern Email**" developer room is new at FOSDEM and seeks speakers,
volunteers, and participants! We want to get together as email
developers/users, learn about each other's projects, have technical
discussions, exchange implementation/operational experiences, and share plans
and visions for the future of email.

The Devroom will be **held on Saturday, February 1** full day, with primarily
talks on the schedule. The **submission deadline for talks is December 1st,
2024**. 

* **Speaker**: As a speaker, you're invited to present your work in the developer room.
* **Volunteer**: As a volunteer, you would be helping us out during the sessions.
* **Participant**: As a participant, whether introverted or extroverted, you
  are excellent to everyone and make the day!

**Please distribute this CfP as widely as possible to interested parties!**

## Side events

### Pre-FOSDEM Hackathon (Friday)

Upon frequent request, we'd like to organize an informal **pre-FOSDEM email
hackathon on Friday** (31st of January). Please [note
here](https://hackmd.io/@ndFSGqY1SC6Cc0DEpHHU1w/r1dkwOAeyx) if you're
interested and if you have ideas/proposals. It would also be great if someone
could provide/recommend a meeting space for the event (we'd expect some 10-20
people probably?).

### Friends-of-Email Dinner (Saturday)

Following last year's good practice, we'd like to reserve a table for an
informal "friends of email" dinner/drinks session either on FRI or SAT evening.
[Note here](https://hackmd.io/@ndFSGqY1SC6Cc0DEpHHU1w/HyMUuORxye) or email us
if you'd like to join, so we can guess the crowed (we were some 20+ people last
time! Venue proposals welcome as well.

## Topics

Some suggestions for talks:

* Overview of the current state of email (as a keynote)
* Your free/open source software project(s) related to email. From demo to details.
* Current developments, upcoming standards, e.g. [JMAP](https://jmap.io),
  [structured email](https://structured.email), ...
* Efforts to modernize our email ecosystem, e.g., through implementations in modern languages.
* Integrating email with other software, e.g., through APIs.
* Message/transport security/authenticity.
* Experiences with deliverability, email operations, anti-spam, hosting, ...
* Related technologies such as calendaring/PIM.
* Visionary talks
    * Where should email be in 10 years?
    * Can we add end-to-end encryption (to the masses) through, e.g., MLS?
    * Can we provide simple solutions for on-prem (private) hosting?
* ...

## Submission

We ask for a short talk abstract (+ proposed duration) and a speaker biography
(+ contact info). Any material that shows your affinity to the field is also
appreciated, e.g., a collection of links to your work, talks, projects, blog
posts, etc.

Submissions **must** be made through Pretalx
(https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2025/cfp) no later than December 1st (23:55 CET).

The suggested duration for a talk is **25 minutes** (20 minutes presentation +
5 minutes Q&A). However, we *explicitly* invite you to propose the best
duration for your talk. If the best way to present your project is a **5-minute
lightning talk**, we'll happily arrange a lightning session!

Depending on the proposals, we may contact you to adapt the time of the session
to fit the devroom schedule.

**Important**: Choose "**Modern Email**" in the track drop-down menu when
submitting your proposal. Otherwise, your proposal might go unnoticed!

Once the devroom schedule is finalized, we will contact you to help you prepare
your talk.
